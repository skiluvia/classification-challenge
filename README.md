Module 13 Challenge classification-challenge

# Overview
**Internet Service Provider (ISP)**
We are trying to improve the email filtering system for our customers. We have been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. We would like to use **supervised machine learning (ML)** model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

We will create two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
